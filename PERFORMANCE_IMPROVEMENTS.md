# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to improve the speed and rendering efficiency of the website.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Implemented React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
- Lazy-loaded all major page components (App, Industries, IndustryDetail, etc.)
- Added prefetching for primary routes to improve navigation performance

### 2. Image Optimization
- Created a LazyImage component that:
  - Implements proper srcset and sizes attributes for responsive loading
  - Uses Intersection Observer to load images only when in viewport
  - Provides blur-up loading effect for better perceived performance
  - Handles loading states and fallbacks appropriately
  - Respects user preferences like reduced motion

### 3. Component Optimizations
- Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized the Industries component with proper memoization
- Reduced the number of rendered items in lists where appropriate
- Added throttling and debouncing for search inputs and other frequently firing events

### 4. Animation Performance
- Reduced animation complexity in components
- Implemented conditional animations based on device capabilities
- Optimized Framer Motion variants for better performance
- Added support for prefers-reduced-motion

### 5. Resource Loading Improvements
- Created a scriptLoader utility to manage external script loading
- Implemented proper async/defer loading strategies
- Added preloading capabilities for critical resources
- Implemented cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- Added Core Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Implemented component render time tracking
- Created performance marking and measuring utilities
- Added a development mode performance logger

### 7. Performance Utilities
- Created a comprehensive performance utilities library
- Implemented debounce and throttle functions for event handling
- Added proper memoization helpers
- Implemented device and network capability detection
- Created viewport visibility utilities

## Specific Optimizations by Component

### main.tsx
- Implemented code splitting with React.lazy
- Added loading fallback component
- Implemented route prefetching for better navigation
- Initialized performance monitoring

### Industries.tsx
- Memoized the IndustryCard component
- Optimized search with debounce
- Reduced the number of rendered items in list views
- Implemented conditional animations based on device capabilities
- Used LazyImage for efficient image loading

### HeroScene.tsx
- Implemented lazy loading for the Spline viewer
- Added Intersection Observer to load 3D content only when visible
- Reduced particle count for better performance
- Optimized animation timings and complexity

## Benefits

- Faster initial page load time
- Reduced Time-to-Interactive (TTI)
- Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Better performance on lower-end devices
- Reduced network payload
- Improved rendering performance
- Better user experience across all device types

## Future Improvements

- Implement server-side rendering for critical pages
- Add proper image CDN with automatic optimizations
- Further optimize third-party script loading
- Implement CSS code splitting
- Add support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- Add resource hints (preconnect, preload) for critical assets
- Implement module/nomodule pattern for better JS compatibility
